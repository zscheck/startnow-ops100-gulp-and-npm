This program was an introduction to gulp. Since there was already an working website, a gulp file was created in order to optimize the performance by use of uglify and concatenate for the .js files and concatenating the css files. These new files sent to a new folder called /dist/ A gulp watch and serve task were also created to moniter the folder for changes, and if there are any, it will reload and run the server.  The server is run on localhost:8080/index.html.
